                <h4>Learning something new is an adventure!</h4>
                <p>Starting a new thing like web programming can be scary, but if something scares you, 
                    then that's how you know you're starting an amazing journey!
                    </p>

                <p>To be stuck on a certain lesson or issue can seem like a headache, but that's how you know that you're learning! 
                    Asking questions or for help is not a sign of weakness, but of growth! You learn so much 
                    by asking questions. It allows you to get out of your head and work with great minds
                    who can really teach you something new or show you a different perspective on a topic.
