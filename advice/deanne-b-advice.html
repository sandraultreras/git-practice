            <h4>Practice Regularly!</h4>
            <p>Consistent Practice: Coding is a skill that improves with regular practice. Set aside dedicated time each
                day or week to code.<br>
                Small Projects: Work on small projects to apply what you've learned. This could be as simple as a
                calculator or a to-do list app.</p>

            <h4>Be Patient and Persistent.</h4>
            <p>Growth Mindset: Understand that learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time and effort,
                and it's okay to make mistakes.<br>
                Celebrate Progress: Celebrate small victories along the way to keep yourself motivated.
            </p>

            <h4>Have Fun!</h4>
            <p>Enjoy the Process: Find joy in solving problems and creating things with code. A positive attitude can
                make the learning process more enjoyable and sustainable.<br> Always remember, "Yes You Can!".</p>
