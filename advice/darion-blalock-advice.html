            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>Confusion is an important part of the learning process! Whether you're a beginner or possess a technical
                background or education, at some point you won't know what you're doing or why your code works or
                doesn't. So try to not to view confusion as a "sign" of bad things to come.</p>
            <p>Ask plenty of questions! The Slack community is your friend. The instructors provide prompt and detailed
                feedback and your peers will often share their challenges as well. So, you're not alone.</p>

            <h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
            <p>Remember that the journey you're on is to learn <strong>skills</strong> and that for most, learning a
                skill is a process takes
                time and practice.
            </p>
            <p>Don't be afraid or ashamed to repeat the material, especially if you feel like you didn't quite grasp it
                initially. You may not fully grasp it the second time either; however, investing the time now can
                prevent long-term challenges in the future.</p>
            <p>There will likely be ebbs and flows in your coding journey, but that doesn't mean it is impossible. Take
                it one step, lesson, and project at a time and try to aim for improving your level of understanding before
                moving forward.</p>
