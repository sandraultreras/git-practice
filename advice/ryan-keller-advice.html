        <h4>On The Use of AI When Coding</h4>
        <p>
          If you use an artificial intelligence (AI) application, such as
          ChatGPT or Co-Pilot, to help you code, make sure you fully understand
          the code the application generates. This will make the collaboration
          between you and the AI more productive, as you'll have a better sense
          as to what prompts to give the AI to help you guide the AI in the
          direction of accomplishing your coding objectives.
