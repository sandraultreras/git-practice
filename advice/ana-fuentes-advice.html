                <p>When you start anything new, its always good to take stock of where to go for help should you get stuck, 
                    need to reference something, need a refresher on a concept, or just plain forgot the name of a command 
                    when working with GitHub. It happens to all of us! Whatever it is, it's nice to know what to do when 
                    you're in need of guidance.</p>

                <p>Luckily, there is <strong>tons</strong> of web development resources availble. There's the Skillcrush community
                    on Slack, lot's of great reference books, and Skillcrush hosts development Q&A's. Additionally Skillcrush provides
                    downloadable documents for important terms as well as relevant sites to bookmark within lessons.</p>
