                <h4>Don't hestitate!</h4>
                <p>Whether you are studying around your current job or other commitments, don't hesitate. 
                    Make a start today. A little bit of coding goes along way. 
                    In one month from now you will have a fresh set of skills you never thought you would have! </p>

                <p>Sometimes you will reach a probelm that seems insurmountable. You will be frustrated!
                    You may want to quit. Again, don't hestitate to ask for help. Use the slack channel or other online
                    forums. The tech community is full of people who have been in your position at one point or another.
                </p>

                <h4>You have to step out of your comfort zone!</h4>
                <p>This is part of learning, if you don't feel a bit of discomfort from 
                    time to time, you are not learning. You are just doing.
                </p>

                <p>Seek additional challenges</p>

                <p>Whether you complete the bonus tasks or start with a small personal
                    project. Aim to do something that utilises your new skills aswell as stretches you to
                    develop some new ones along the way. Solve a new problem, do some research, read a blog, watch a 
                    tutorial. Every little counts.
