                <h4>Trial by Error!</h4>
                <p>When you start coding, you may be learning something completely new! I found it helpful to take the focus off the pace I was completing the courses and focus on the fact that I was learning. If a problem comes up, think of it as an opportunity to learn something new and increase your knowledge, rather than hindering your progress.</p>
                <h4>Walking Away</h4>
                <p>When you have tried an exercise several times through and feel "stuck", it is helpful to step away from the problem. You can move on to something different or take a break. Sometimes this is exactly what I needed to find a solution. 
                </p>
                <h4>Repeat!</h4>
                <p>Trying an exercise several times over helps me to figure out what I need to fix if the code is not working as expected.</p>
                <h4>Your Problem is Most Likely Not a New Problem</h4>
                <p>Befriend google, Skillcrush resourses, and new resources! If you have a problem, someone else has likely experienced the same problem. You just need to find it!</p>
