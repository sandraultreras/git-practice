                <h4>Breath!</h4>
                <p>It may sound pretty basic, but on more than one occasion just stopping to take a breath has saved me 
                    hours of hair pulling, cursing, and tears. If something's gone wrong give yourself some grace. Go
                    back a step or two. Remember that there is no coding situation that exists that can't be reworked.</p>

                <h4>When you feel like giving up...Give Up! (But only for a little while)</h4>
                <p> Remember that you don't have to learn all of this in one day. Remember you <strong>can't</strong> learn
                    all of this in one day. Coding languages are big, complex things with a ton of nuance and sometimes
                    counter intuitive logic. While some of the rules will start to seem like second nature, a lot of others
                    may be forever a mystery. And that's okay!</p>
