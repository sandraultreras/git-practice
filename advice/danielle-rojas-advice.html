        <h4>Embrace the Learning Journey!</h4>
        <p>
          Starting to code your first web app is an exciting adventure filled
          with new challenges and opportunities. It's a path of discovery where
          every step forward is a victory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Struggle is a sign of growth. When you feel lost or confused, it means
          you’re pushing your boundaries and learning something new. Embrace
          these moments as they indicate you’re on the right track. Each hurdle
          you overcome makes you a better problem solver and a more skilled
          developer.
        </p>

        <h4>Patience and Persistence are key.</h4>
        <p>
          Learning a new technology or programming language can be daunting. You
          might not grasp everything immediately, and that's perfectly okay.
          It's important to be patient with yourself and persistent in your
          efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
          The initial confusion when encountering new concepts is natural. It's
          part of the learning process. Over time, as you read and write more
          code, things will start to click, and what once seemed complex will
          become clearer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Keep pushing through the
          tough moments, and you'll find the clarity and confidence you're
          seeking. Happy coding!
