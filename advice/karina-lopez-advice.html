                <h4>Replace "I don't get this" with "I wonder..."</h4>
                <p>When you start learning to code, you're literally learning a new language, with all of the marvels and missteps that come with it. </p>

                <p>We've all been there: you're humming along when you hit a speed bump. Little makes sense and it all feels confusing.
                    It's in this exact moment that you want to change your self-talk.  
                    Instead of saying "I'm so confused, I don't get this", get curious, and say to yourself: 
                     <b>I wonder</b> how this works" or  <b> "Hmmm...I wonder</b> what's missing?"
                    This quickly takes you from an anxious space to one of openmindedness, where creativity and insights reside. </p>

                <h4>Ask for help.</h4>
                <p>Sometimes, when you come across a problem, asking yourself <b>"I wonder"</b> is enough to get you through.
                    That, however, won't always be the case. If you find yourself getting stuck,<b>ask for help</b> 
                    One of the great things about Skillcrush and the tech community more broadly is that people are always
                    willing to help you solve problems. Don't be afraid to ask
                    for help; the questions that you ask are important because they are a part of <b>your</b> learning journey. 
                    No question or concern is too big or too small, so reach out and ask for help whenever you need it. </p>
