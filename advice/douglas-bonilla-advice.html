                <h4>Discipline vs Motivation</h4>
                <p>Remember good habits turn to great characteristics. Discipline is the ability tto stick to a plan or routine, even when motivation begins to wane. 
                    Motivation is the drive or desire to do something. These both characteristics go hand in hand but people make the mistake and believe by having motivation
                    anything is possible. Fact of the matter is discipline is what will make anything possible. When you condition yourself to having discipline in your everyday life,
                    you'll accomplish much more even when you aren't motivated. </p>
