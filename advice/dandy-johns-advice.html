            <h2>Remember you're not alone.</h2>
            <p>Learning front-end development can be a rollercoaster, but your determination and perseverance are your
                strongest allies. As you navigate the realm of coding, remember that you're never alone.</p>

            <p>Tap into the Skillcrush Slack community to connect with fellow learners and instructors. Don't hesitate
                to ask questions, share your struggles, and celebrate small wins together.</p>

            </p>When you are stuck on a challenging concept, remember to breath, reference past lessons, check your
            notes, and that Google is your ally; countless resources and tutorials are there to guide you. </p>

            <h2>Honor yourself!</h2>
            <p>Learning to code might sometimes feel like deciphering a puzzle, but every "ah ha!" moment is a step
                forward.</p>

            <p>Celebrate and reward yourself, <strong>especially</strong> when things don't make sense- you're learning
                a new language; how bada** is that?!</p>

            <p>And when Git feels like you're lost in The Matrix, channel your inner <span class="tnt">TNT</span>: Tank, Neo,
                Trinity (and Morpheus!); just like them, you'll work your way out of any coding labyrinth. </p>
