                <p>I'm going to say something that's pretty obvious, being out of your comfort zone
                probably feels
                uncomfortable. Those doubts and fears may have crept in. You may feel lost, stuck, and don't understand
                what you're doing or why. But hey, you're learning something completely new. Those feelings are
                completely normal. It takes time for all these brand new things we are learning to sink in. Which brings
                me to my next pointâ€¦</p>

                <h4>Be Gentle with Yourself</h4>

                <p>You may be feeling frustrated with yourself that things are clicking right away. But remember how far
                    you've come from the decision to sign up for the program up until now! You're learning A LOT! It's not
                    just learning how to read, or even just write in a new language. You're also learning how to solve
                    problems all in a language that is brand new to you! So be kind to yourself. You need to give yourself a
                    break! Figuratively andâ€¦

                <h4>LITERALLY. Give Yourself A Break.</h4>

                <p>Yes, I get it. You want to learn these things as fast as possible so that you can
                    get out there in the world of tech! You want to power through the lessons and projects so you can go
                    out there and get your dream job! I'm right there with you... It seems to be going well and then all of a suddenâ€¦</p>
                <p>You've hit a wall. You're stuck and you can't find the issue. Don't panic. It's solvable. Give yourself a
                    break. Step away from the computer. Go get some fresh air. Do some yoga. Put on your favorite song and have a dance party.
                    (Grey's Anatomy anyoneâ€¦?). Drink some water. Get some sleep. Try tackling that issue now. You may find that tackling
                    that issue may be a bit easier with fresh eyes.

                <p>You've tried to literally give yourself a break and still can't solve the issueâ€¦ That's absolutely okay.
                    Normal even. Don't be afraid to ask for help!</p>

                    opportunity to join this wonderful community. Terrible puns asideâ€¦</p>
                <p>There are instructors and fellow students that are willing to help you figure out why things aren't
                    looking quite right. There are people that have been in your shoes, made the same mistakes, and they can

                <p>You're learning new languages. Of course there is going to be some confusion along the way. But you
                    know what helps? (HINT: It's in the titleâ€¦) Practice. Repetition is your friend. Review those notes
                    and
                    study guides. Do all the projects. That's why it is all there for us! Experiment with things so you
                    can
                    see what works and what doesn't. And don't be afraid to make mistakes along the way! That's how you
                    get
                    better!</p>
                <p>(BONUS: Take this project for example. Could you speed through it? Absolutely. But why don't you make it
                    you're own! Play around with all the skills you've learned in previous lessons. Take this
                    opportunity to
                    practice those skills without being told exactly what to do. You have the chance to have fun and experiment! Make those
                    mistakes
                    and make your skills better ðŸ˜‰)</p>
