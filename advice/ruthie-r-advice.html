                    <h3>1. Take A <span>Break</span></h3>
                    <p>Letting yourself rest is an essential part of the process of learning to code. If you're feeling burnt out/discouraged (or even if you're not), feel free to give yourself time to chill out a bit, then get back on the horse!</p>

                    <h3>2. <span>Build</span> Stuff</h3>
                    <p>The most efficient way to learn is through experience! Plan projects that interest you and that will be not too challenging but not too easy either and that will help you prove to yourself and your future employers that you know what you're talking about.</p>

                    <h3>3. <span>Believe</span> You Are More Than Capable</h3>
                    <p>It may be difficult to fight past the imposter syndrome and self-doubt, but it helps when you understand that the only one truly standing between you and your dreams is you! Believe that you can and you will!</p>
