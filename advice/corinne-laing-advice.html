                <h4>Brain Burn is on the Horizon</h4>
                <p>Learning to code is challenging and it does make your brain feel like its (figuratively) on fire. Brain burn is part of the process and is normal. It does make the moment you overcome it and figure something out, all the more satisfying!</p>

                <p>In fact if you don't feel brain burn at some point, I'd go as far to say you're not pushing yourself close enough to your learning edge!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="advice-2">
                <h4>Give yourself Grace</h4>
                <p>It's not going to be all smooth sailing, there will be challenges and you may feel like giving up. I say - let that grace flow. You are allowed to take a minute, or step away completely and return another day. And that's ok. 

                <p>Don't get into the trap of comparing yourself to where others are at on the journey or where they are shining and you may not be. We all have our unique areas of natural shine, and everyone has their challenges too.</p>

                <p>Small steps yield big results - keep on that train of consistency and you will achieve your goals! You got this!!!</p>
