                <h4>Stay Consistent.</h4>
                <p>Sometimes you can get stuck on a problem that you can't figure out. Or maybe you get busy in your personal life and you go a few days without coding/studying. This only sets you back in your progress. Take it from me- always make time to study at least once a day. Take breaks when you need it. But stay consistent. Taking extended periods of time off only sets you back in your goals. Playing catch up in regressive.</p>

                <h4>Remind yourself often that you are never done learning.</h4>
                <p>In the tech industry, things are always evolving. Yes, you can learn a language and become efficient in it. But there will always be updates, new languages, and changes happening in the tech industry. Change is consistent. Remain flexible and always continue to learn. The work is never done.
