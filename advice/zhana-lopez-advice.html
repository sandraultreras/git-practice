            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Even when things are difficult, don't give up!</h4>
            <p>When you are learning anything new there will always be obstacles and challenges to tackle. The best way
                to overcome them is to keep trying until it makes sense and works the way you want it.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process. While learning how to program I have had to redo projects, retake notes, and figure out
                many problems. Even though it can be frustrating in the moment, it is very satisfying to resolve issues
                and see completed projects come to life. </p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>
