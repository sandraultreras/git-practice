            <h4>Getting Started</h4>
            <p>The beginnings of your coding journey can look and feel like the start of a trek up Mt. Everest, only in
                this instance, the mountain's a big pile of code! But don't fret, take things a step at a time, and
                don't get discouraged if you stumble a few times along the way. You'll reach the top soon enough! </p>



            <h4>The Learning Process</h4>
            <p>When faced with so much new information, so many processes, terms, etc., it's easy to become
                overwhelmed. A proper, tried and true strategy is to simply re-read the information as many times as
                necessary, allowing it to become cemented into your mind. Also, practice makes perfect! The more you code,
                the more famliar with it you'll become, and the better you'll be!
            </p>

            <h4>And Lastly...</h4>

            <p>Have fun!</p>
