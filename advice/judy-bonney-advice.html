                <h4>Believe in Yourself!</h4>
                <p>It can feel intimidating to learn new skills but you can do it! 
                    Your brain can form new neural networks when you practice something. 
                    Believe you can do it, and you will!</p>

                <p>The more you challenge yourself and do things that are difficult for you, the stronger your 
                    new neural pathways will become, and the more comfortable you will feel with your new skills.</p>

                <h4>Practice, practice, practice</h4>
                <p>It's a lot to take in at first and you won't understand everything. That is to be expected.
                    The only way to change that is by spending the time to really practice the new things you're learning.
                    New skills take time! Don't be discouraged if you still don't understand something after reviewing it several times.
                    Practice leads to progress!
                </p>

                <p>With beleif in yourself, practice, and persistence, anyone can complete this course and learn these new skills.
