                    <h4>It's okay to not be at the skill level you expect yourself to be at.</h4>
                    <p> There's a lot to learn when you start coding and there's many routes you can take and discover. You
                        can grasp some topics easier than others. Sometimes you need to do a quick google search as a refresher.
                        As long as you steer forward learning along the way you will definitely improve.

                    <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                        before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                        so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                        have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                        to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                    <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                        language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                        the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                        of the process.</p>

                    <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
