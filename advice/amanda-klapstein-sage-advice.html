        <h4>Stay the course!</h4>
        <p>Learning to code is inevitably going to get weird and uncomfortable and hard at some point in your
            journey. Dig in and stay determined. Many students have come before you who are now well into
            their professional careers.</p>

        <p>Everything in this life worth doing takes effort. Some things will come easily and at other times you
            will struggle. It's also easy to get intimidated by the vast depth of the programming and tech field.
            Just take it one step at a time. Believe in yourself. Do the work. Before you know it you will be at the
            top of the mountain.</p>

        <h4>Practice, practice, practice</h4>
        <p>Read and write the coding languarge you are learning as much as possible. Throw yourself into the
            process. I am one those people who learn best by doing. I could watch lectures and read examples all
            day, but until I actually dive into the project work nothing really sticks...it's all in the ether.</p>

        <p>I suggest brainstorming a passion project. Not only will you get experience - you will build your
            portfolio. Passion projects are awesome for motivation because you're learning your technical skills
            whilst applying it to a topic or hobby of personal interested. Perfect.
        </p>

        <p><span>Best of luck!</span></p>
