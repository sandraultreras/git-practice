                <h4>Finding the Rigth Path!</h4>
                <p>When you want to start learning how to program, it is very difficult to find the right path. There is
                    a lot of information available in all mediums about software development. You hear much information
                    about how to become a software developer. Sometimes, this information is contradictory.</p>

                <p>It is normal to be confused because there are couple pathways to become a software developer, a traditional computer
                     Science degree, a bootcamp, or self-learning. Everyone defends the path that he knows.</p>

                <p>You should get good advice from experienced software developers. They will help you to find the right
                    path for you.</p>

                <h4>Learning how to do research online</h4>
                <p>Programming is sometimes challenging. It is important to know that you are going to meet many issues
                    during your coding journeys, and while you are installing software tools that you are going to use. To solve these issues, 
                    you might have to find the solutions by yourself, so doing research online can be one option.</p>

                <p>Google search, Stack overflow and many other websites can help you to find solutions to many problems
                    that you will encounter.</p>
