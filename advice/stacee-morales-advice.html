                <h4>Confusion and mistakes are your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and you're bound to be confused at first. 
                    Just keep going and commit to working through the confusion.</p>

                <p>Confusion is a good thing because it is a sign you are being challenged. So please don't give up. The challenge is 
                    to keep going and you WILL begin to gain clarity.</p>

                <h4>Mistakes also play an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are writing code or working within a framework, 
                    you are bound to make mistakes. You will go through this uncomfortable phase 
                    where what you've created is doing this weird thing and you don't understand what is happening.
                    Getting to the bottom of it and finding the correct solution helps you gain experience and reduce mistakes.</p>

                <p>Confusion and mistakes are a normal and absolutely critical part of the process of learning a new technology.</p>

                <p>Gaining clarity happens when you learn to train both your eye and your brain. Training your eye invoves reading lines of code, even when you don't
                    totally understand it, until it becomes more and more familiar. Training your brain involves making mistakes, working through them and digging deeper to discover the correct solutions.</p>
