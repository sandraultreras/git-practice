            <h4>If it doesn't work the first time do it again!</h4>
            <p>When you start learning how to code whether its a new coding language or best practices for working on
                github with a team,
                there will be many first time's that will be unsuccessful. You may miss a period, lowercase something
                that should be capitalized or keep misspelling a file name.
                Coding will not be perfect so its best to approach each project understanding that your first try may be
                just that- a try. Approaching coding from the mindset you will need to "do it again" to acquire your
                expected outcome
                will help with dissapointment and frustration down the road. </p>

            <p> Leaning in to "do it again", will not only create perserverance muscles that youll need to become an
                expert coder, it will
                help to hone your problem solving skills. You will literally learn from every mistake!
            </p>

            <h4>You don't need to always know the how just the what!
            </h4>
            <p>When you are leanring to code you may find all of the coding langauges and
                different ways of doing things to be overwhelming. Remeber, even if you do not understand how something
                is happening, if you can get it
                to do what you need sometimes that is enough to get you to the next step. So lean into the fact that
                knowing what you need to do can lead you to the how. </p>
