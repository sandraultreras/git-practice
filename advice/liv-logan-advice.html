                <h4>Clean code is key!</h4>
                <p>Make sure your code is as organized as possible! It makes your code easier to read and helps you find specific lines of code faster. It also makes you look more professional.</p>

                <p>Keeping your coding clean not only helps you, but helps other people who want to work with your code. Team projects are much easier when everything is organized!</p>

                <h4>Don't be afraid to ask for help!</h4>
                <p>Even the best coders can get stuck on a tricky line of code. If you are having trouble, there are plenty of resources and forums to help you out! Skillcrush even has a Slack community that can help with any questions you may have.
                </p>

                <p>It would be nearly impossible to memorize every command and tag. Don't be afraid to use the cheatsheets Skillcrush provides. Or make your own!</p>

                <p>Remember that you are learning a whole new language, so go easy on yourself. Some days you may fly through lines of code while on others you may get stuck trying to fix a simple problem. We are all learning. Never give up.</p>
