            <h4>Practice practice and practice!</h4>
            <p>When you start with HTML and CSS, it seems very easy in the beginning, but it keeps getting harder and
                more complex with time, at least for me. I learned that with each new project, I keep getting better and
                more conscious about what exactly am I doing.</p>

            <p>I recommend to go through projects as many times as you need in order to understand everything and maybe
                to create your own little project. Maybe you have a friend which could use some cool website and like
                this you will help to both of you.</p>

            <h4>Keep yourself motivated :) </h4>
            <p>Sometimes, you might feel very tired and not very focused on studies. Especially if you currently have a
                full time job which is not your dream job. So just imagine, how your life can look like, and will look
                like, after you learn all these amazing Tech Skills!
            </p>

            <p>And when itâ€™s simply not your day and codes are â€žnot listening to youâ€œ, take a break, go for a walk,
                dance, whatever works for you and get your brain back on track.</p>

            <p>45 minutes study and 15 minutes short break works very well. Your brain works magically better after that
                break and stays focused each second from all those 45 minutes. Try it out ðŸ˜Š.</p>
