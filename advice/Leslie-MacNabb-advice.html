            <h4>Let Curiousity Be Your Guide!</h4>
            <p>When you start learning to code, you will sometimes have no idea why you are being told to do something or
                how it is even going to turn out. That's okay! Think of coding as a fun roadtrip where you are noticing
                new paths and taking in all the scenery. </p>

            <p>Staying curious both when you succeed and when you fail...because you will fail, will help keep you
                moving forward. Asking questions like, WHY did that work? or WHY didn't that work? and What happens if I do
                this?...will keep it interesting and fun!</p>

            <h4>Just walk away Renee... or whatever your name is.</h4>
            <p>It's really fun when your code works, like hey, I did that! But when your code doesn't work and you try
                something else which does work and then you try a few more things that still don't work, you're probably
                building up some frustration. Totally typical. My best advice for these times is to close your laptop
                and walk away. Just get up and do something completely different. When you are feeling fresh,
                rejuvenated and determined, then go back and give it a go. Some things just need to marinate in your
                brain juices in order to be figured out!
            </p>

            <p>Some ideas for what to do when you take a break include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Literally, anything else</li>
                <li>Take a nap</li>
                <li>Shower or bathe</li>
                <li>Physical activity</li>
                <li>Play with your kids or your animals</li>
                <li>Have a dance party for one</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Determination is cool, but sometimes can cause more barriers if frustrated. Think about things you
                figured out in the past that were difficult at one time. It doesn't always happen the first time and
                coding is no different! Recognize your growth over time and take more naps.</p>
