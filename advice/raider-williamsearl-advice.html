            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>Practice Patience & Acceptance With Yourself</h4>
            <p>We're all excited to learn new things. The problem comes when we don't grasp the concept fast enough to
                live up to our expectations of ourselves or when we struggle with something and simply get angry we
                can’t get something right. Everyone learns at their own pace and everything happens when it needs to
                happen. Having patience and acceptance that you will get it eventually is critical in not becoming
                frustrated and rage quitting. If you feel yourself getting angry take a break, go get a drink of water.
                You don’t have to give up for the day but sometimes a 10-15 minute brain break can help. On that note:
            </p>

            <h4>Breaks, Fidgets, and Brain Food!</h4>
            <p>Breaks are critical to helping retain concepts. After an hour of learning a concept a ten to 15-minute
                break really can help your mind reset and not feel so overwhelmed. Another thing you can do for yourself
                while you’re learning is have fidgets and pieces of candy like a Jolly Rancher or something else small.
                Having a small piece of candy like Dum-Dum or some playdough in your hand can help us focus and hold
                attention to a concept. I know these really helped me when I was in school (Thanks Mrs. Weatherred for
                teaching me this) but now also as I am going back to school. Breaks, fidgets, and brain food are
                especially helpful for those neurodivergent baddies out there. You may need more breaks than every hour,
                but that’s ok. Take that time as you need. Give yourself grace and acceptance on that front too!
