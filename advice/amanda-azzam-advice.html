          <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
          <p>
            When you start programming your first web app you are doing
            something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a
            new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
            so specific that it's probably never been done before.
          </p>

          <p>
            Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
            direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem
            solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for
            you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.

          <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
          <p>
            When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to
            write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,
            you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code
            you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW
            exactly it's happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology,
            and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
            learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to
            train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
            totally understand what it's doing.

          <h4>Also remember:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Set realistic goals:</strong> Break down your learning
              into small achievable goals, such as learning a new HTML tag or
              CSS property. Celebrate each small victory, and use that momentum
              to keep going.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Don't compare yourself to others:</strong> Remember that
              everyone learns at their own pace, and everyone's journey is
              different. Don't get discouraged if you see others who seem to be
              progressing faster than you are. Focus on your own progress and
              growth.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Embrace failure:</strong> Failure is a natural part of the
              learning process. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, as they can be
              some of the best learning opportunities. Learn from your failures
              and use that knowledge to improve.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Keep practicing:</strong> The more you practice, the
              better you will become. Set aside time each day to practice
              coding, even if it's just for a few minutes. Consistency is key.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Stay curious:</strong> Always be open to learning new
              things and exploring new technologies. The web development
              industry is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay
              up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Find a supportive community:</strong> (Hey, Skillcrush!)
              Surround yourself with other web developers who can offer
              encouragement, feedback, and support. Join online forums, attend
              meetups, and connect with others in the industry.
            </li>
            <p>
              Remember that learning web development is a journey, and it takes
              time and effort to become proficient. But with perseverance,
              practice, and a positive attitude, you can achieve your goals and
              become a successful web developer. Good luck!
