                <h4><span>Give yourself time to absorb the information.</span></h4>
                <p>Bootcamp can be fast and furious! Give yourself time to understand the terminology.</p>

                <p>Some ways that you can do this include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flashcards</li>
                        <li>Using the terminology in everyday life</li>
                        <li>Bookmarking websites that will help you better comprehend the intricacies of coding</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h4><span>Try to keep up with your studies!</span></h4>
                <p>Make sure to experiment and code every day! Find an excuse to play with your new skills and apply what you have learned.</p>
                
                <p> Even if it's just for 30 minutes, build on your skills so that you can expand and enhance your experience.</p>
                
                <h4><span>Have some fun!</span></h4>
                <p>Tap into that inquistive side of you! Allow yourself to be imaginative and challenge yourself!</p>
                
                <p>See if you can make your wildest visions come true and then practice!</p>
                
                <h4><span>Remember to give yourself grace!</span></h4>
                <p>You will be learning so many new skills and building new pathways that you may become intimidated. Remember that Rome was not built in a day and the best thing you can do is to keep at!</p>

                <p>Keep failing and then fail again fore there is a lesson in every new beginning.</p>
                
                <p>Keep growing and the rest will be cake!</p>
