            <h4> Take your own notes!</h4>
            <p> Once you run through the exercises following the instructions, you've accomplished the goal but aren't
                always sure of why things happened. What commands made certain things happen and what dependancies
                there are between files that made it happen. Print it out and read through it. Look at each file and
                see how they are connected. GO back over the assignment and write down next to a command(class, id etc
                in CSS) why you put that in there. What were you trying to achieve and what was the result. Sometimes,
                when you sit down and really look at the details, and how they affect the big picture, it all comes
                together. There is an AH-HA moment where you say "That's why it worked that way!" and you will remember
                it better, not becasue you memorized the steps you followed in the exercise, but because you now
                understand what each step did and how it affected the big picture. Moving forward you can remember that
                if you do this,that will happen and be able to apply that one little detail in a completely different
                scenario and achieve the outcome you are looking for. </p>
