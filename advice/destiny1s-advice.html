                <h4>Write or Type Out Notes for Yourself as You Go</h4>
                <p>As you work through the Skillcrush lessons, it is beneficial to take your own notes as you go because
                    writing notes in your own words will help with retention and provide a better understanding of the
                    concepts you
                    are learning. <br>

                    <br>When you write out your own notes, you can write them out in a way that is considerate of future
                    you
                    after a significant amount of time has passed. As you go through the skillcrush lessons you will be
                    learning a lot and may forget a lot as well, having notes to refer to that are detailed and all in
                    one place are a lifesaver when you need to go back and review a step of a process or a concept that
                    you
                    may have forgotten about.

                <h4>Try Not to Get Discouraged Easily</h4>
                <p>When learning something for the first time there will always be roadblocks and problems that arise because
                    everything is new and unfamiliar to you. But don't give up! What you may not understand initially
                    will
                    come to you in time, and the more you sit with and practice the material, the better you will become! Also, if more information or
                    direction is needed, there are tons of videos and resources online that can further assist you!</p>
