                <h4>You are not a Castaway!</h4>
                <p>In the movie Castaway, Tom Hanks only has his make believe friend. Tom recognized that while suspended 
                    on an island, the necessity of having a friend.  As an older adult, beginning over again can seem 
                    isolating, scary, and uncomfortable. Somewhat like being on a deserted island. You may even begin 
                    to talk to yourself, even outloud sometimes.</p>
                    <!--I recognize, that I do not need to know everything immediately and within an instant. In the coding world, there are 
                    people to assist you in your problem-solving journeys. -->

                <p>Building and learning new skills takes time. We first need to be introduced to the subject 
                    and begin to build our knowledge and understanding. Collecting knowledge is where we can say, 
                    "Oh, I have heard about this!" We may not be able to replicate what we have 
                    been introduced to, but we know enough to be able to follow along with the topic.
                    As we increase our knowledge, understanding develops. Things begin to make sense. 
                    We can do some things with our new knowledge. Using that knowledge develops understanding, where we really start to grow.
                    Understanding leads into creative problem-solvering. We can answer some of our 
                    own questions. We may even be able to help someone with an issue. When we become comfortable
                    in using what we know and understand, we can take that foundation and transfer our foundation into learning 
                    new things like another coding language.</p>

                <h4>You can do great things in the tech world!</h4>
                <p>You are never to old to change your career path. Have faith in yourself and challenge yourself daily to learn 
                    something new. Reach out to others and build a community with supportive people so that you can help each other. 
                    While learning something new and unfimilar can feel like you are stranded on a deserted island,
                    you are not alone. The tech community is filled with others that have gone on before you and are willing to 
                    help you on your journey.</p>

                <p>
                </p>

                <p>So, remind yourself, that you are not alone, that are people here to help you as you begin an exciting new journey
                    that can lead to a rewarding career. Reach out to others and build your community. 
                    While Wilson was a dedicated friend to Tom Hanks for years, Tom still needed more than a him to get off that island.</p>
