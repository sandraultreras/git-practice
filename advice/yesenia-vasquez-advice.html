        <h1>Hi, my name is Skillcrush and I have some advice for you!</h1>
    </header>

        <div class="advice">
            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>Consistentcy is key</h4>

            <p> Everybody is going through their journey of learning how to code. Some are barely beginning and
                others have experience learning on their own. I have some experience with HTML and CSS before
                Skillcrush but I wasn't consistent with my learning. I learned here and there but I didn't make time to
                continue learning till now. My advice is to be consistent in coding. Keep learning and have a plan in
                mind and stick with it. Have a planner to organize and prioritize your day. There are going to be hard
                days when you will fall out of the wagon and it is okay, but pick yourself up and go back to where you left
                off and carry on.</p>

            <h4>Have fun!</h4>

            <p>Coding can be challenging and it can make you doubt yourself as a coder, but you got this. Trust your
                skills and have fun throughout the process. If you don't have fun, make it fun. One of the things I do to
                make coding fun is playing around with the CSS. I test out some of the styles, and add/delete some images.
            </p>

            <h4>Don't be hard on yourself</h4>

            <p> Making mistakes is part of learning and growing. There are times when you make mistakes and feel
                like you are a horrible coder but know that you are doing fine. People make mistakes and it is normal.
                Nobody is perfect and you will be encountering issues along the way so don't be hard on yourself. It is
                okay to ask for help.
