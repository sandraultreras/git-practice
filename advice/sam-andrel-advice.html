                <h4>The fact that you're here means everything.</h4>
                <p>Congrats on starting your coding journey! Seriously, the fact that you're here right now, enrolled in this program, ready to start learning how to code, means you've taken the first step towards fulfilling your pursuit of a new hobby, or a career change. You're the person who said you were going to change your circumstances and learn new skills, and then did exactly that. You should be <strong>so proud</strong> of yourself--I'm certainly proud of you!</p>

                <h4>You're going to make mistakes. And that's okay.</h4>
                <p>Learning anything new is a challenge. Learning an entirely new system for communication and building can be especially daunting. My advice to you is to just dive in. Go for it, fully knowing that you will stumble along the way. You'll receive error messages, get frustrated over a command not correctly rendering on a page, and deploy changes that need to be pulled offline last-minute. 
                </p>

                <p>This is all a completely normal part of the learning process. You can't learn and grow as a developer without making mistakes and learning from them. Take note of what went wrong, study up on concepts you've having a bit more trouble grasping, and continue moving forward from there. I promise, you got this!</p>
