                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. In the case of software development it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit. </p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process and in fact, it's a critical part.</p>

                <p>learn to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand it.</p>
