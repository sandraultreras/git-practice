                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Coding may seem extremely daunting as you begin to learn and that is totally normal. It may be confusing
                    to remember all of the new lingo, and all of the different things you can do. I know i felt pretty overwhelmed
                    learning css because of how many different parts go into making a website look good. The thing I found the 
                    most helpful was consistency.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Consistency is Key.</h4>
                <p>When learning anything knew in general but especially coding, lots and lots of practice is vital for it to
                    become second nature. The more you practice, the easier it is to just know what to do and it will eventually
                    become secind nature.
                </p>

                <p>Staying consistent with learning and having a thirst for knowledge will make learning any kind of coding
                    that much easier. Once you get in a groove, it will be that much easier to remember all the different
                     componants that go into different aspects of coding and how they all connect.
                </p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
