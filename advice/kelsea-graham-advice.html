            <h4>Seek out multiple sources</h4>
            <p>If you don't understand the subject as presented by Skillcrush, do some googling. For example, I watched
                two different "Github for dummies" videos because the topic was just not sticking.</p>
            <h4>Bask in the objectivity</h4>
            <p>There's multiple, more effecient ways to do things, but it either works or it doesn't. I'm sure I'll
                still be told to make the logo bigger though.</p>
            <h4>Functions are fun</h4>
            <p>"If this, then this" seems to be the base formula in computer programming languages. So, maybe its less
                about the syntax itself and more about the efficiency/conciseness of your code.</p>
