            <h1>Hi, my name is <em>Tammala</em> and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Welcome to your new language!</h4>
                    <p>In this venture, the codes become your new language. Its amazing, interesting, 
                        and frustrating all at the same time. These various ups, downs, round and rounds 
                        can have you on an emotional rollercoaster, and sometimes make you question if 
                        you should go forward. That hesitance fades once you successfully launch your code. 
                        Now, there is nothing more <em>satisfying</em> than to see your work in motion.
                    <p> The biggest thing I hold with me is to stay positive and open-minded. You have to 
                        believe that you can do anything that you put your mind to, knowing and accepting 
                        that will reign success!</p>
                </p>
