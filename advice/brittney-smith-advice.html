    </header>

        <div class="advice">
            <h4>THE DOs:</h4>
            <p>If possible, work on your schooling everyday, even for just 15 minutes. Get
                into the habit!
            </p>

            <p>Take notes, including detailed step-by-step instructions for later reference.</p>

            <p>Google! Google! Google!</p>

            <p>Work on side projects in order to retain learned skills. Make it fun! It'll come in
                handy later!
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>THE DON'Ts:</h4>

            <p>Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>

            <p>Don't be afraid to make mistakes. We learn when we make mistakes. So when we come across
                a similar problem in the future, we'll know what to do.
            </p>

            <p>Don't be afraid to ask questions. Just think, children ask many questions. That's how
                they learn. Want to learn more about a new topic? Ask questions! People tend to
                respect others for wanting to learn more about a subject.
            </p>

        <div class="final-statement">
            <h4>Just One More Thing...</h4>
            <p>I hope this helped out a bit! Learning web development is not easy, but it is worth
                the hard effort that we put in. Just take it a day at a time! On occasion, take a look
                at your progress to see how much you have learned!</p>
