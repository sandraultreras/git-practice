            <h4>Embrace Breaks: Recharge and Gain Clarity!</h4>
            <p>Feeling frustrated or stuck? Give yourself permission to take breaks. Stepping away from the challenge
                can help you regain focus and clarity. Engage in activities that relax your mind, whether it's going for
                a walk, practicing mindfulness, or pursuing a hobby. By creating space for relaxation, you open up
                opportunities for <span>fresh ideas</span> and <span>solutions</span> to emerge. Return to your Git
                learning with a renewed
                perspective and increased problem-solving abilities.</p>

            <p>Embrace breaks as an essential part of your learning process, and you'll find yourself approaching Git
                with <span>renewed energy</span>, clarity, and improved outcomes</p>

        <div class="second-advice">
            <h4>Triumph over Discouragement: Celebrate Achievements.</h4>
            <p>Learning Git is a journey, and it's natural to face moments of discouragement. In those times, remind
                yourself of your <span>initial goals</span> and <span>motivations</span>. Celebrate your achievements,
                no matter how small.
                Acknowledge your progress and reward yourself along the way. Recognizing your accomplishments boosts
                confidence, rejuvenates your enthusiasm, and helps you overcome setbacks. Stay resilient and remember
                that every step forward is a step closer to mastery.
            </p>

            <p><span>Reward</span> yourself with a sweet bite of success, just like savoring a piece of rich, indulgent
                chocolate
                after achieving a milestone in your Git learning journey.</p>
