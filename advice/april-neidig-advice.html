            <h4>Notes are your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start learning how to use HTML, CSS, Git, etc. you want to make sure you are taking notes! I
                told myself that I didn't need to take notes and that just downloading the reference guides would be
                fine. Boy was I wrong! I wish I took some more in depth notes that way I could look back and remember
                how I added, changed, or fixed code.
            </p>

            <p>Needing to go back into your notes will happen more than you think and by double checking and referencing
                will help you start to remember more. Don't doubt yourself and be confident with what you remember. </p>

            <h4>It's okay to not know.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning something new, you will second-guess yourself all the time. Don't fret! Fully
                understanind how something works and why it works takes time and practice. You won't be an expert right
                away, and if you are then you are a genius and props to you! Take your time and make sure you understand
                something before pushing forward.
            </p>

            <p>Taking your time, taking notes, and asking questions will help you be the best coder and learner you can
                be. Definitely reach out to others when you are confused or when you need help. The Skillcrush mentors
                are there for you!</p>
