            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>Practice and review regularly</h4>
            <p>When you are learning something new, such as GitHub, it's best to study every day. Even a few minutes a
                day will keep the new concepts you're learning fresh in your mind. At the beginning of each session,
                take some time to review what you learned the day before moving on to new concepts. Also, keep coding
                new projects using the skills you've already learned to keep them fresh in your mind.</p>

            <h4>Don't be afraid to ask for help</h4>
            <p>If you're in over your head and haven't gotten anywhere with your own resources, don't be afraid to reach
                out to someone! Most people will be glad you asked and generous with their advice. They'd rather you ask
                for help than go it alone, especially if you're working as part
                of a team. If you don't have a friend or colleague who codes, the community on Skillcrush is super
                helpful! Also, go to local or online meetups to meet other coders who are farther along than you on your
                journey.</p>

            <h4>Version control is your friend</h4>
            <p>Don't forget to create a branch if you're working on GitHub or make a copy of a file before you start
                working on it. That way, if something happens that you can't undo, you can go back to a previous
                version.</p>

            <h4>You CAN do this!</h4>
            <p>You are never too old, or too young, to learn to code! People of all ages and backgrounds have learned to
                code. Don't be intimidated by the thought of walking into a meetup and seeing no one who shares your
                background: you belong there just as much as anyone else! If there's no one in your local community who
                you can look up to or relate to, join an online community, or search YouTube until you find someone who
                inspires you. Keep persisting, aim to get 1% better every day, and don't give up!</p>
