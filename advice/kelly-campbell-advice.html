                <h2>Just Start!</h2>
                <p>When you’re first considering learning how to code, or anything new for that matter, it can seem
                    scary & overwhelming.🤯 Many times this fear can stop you before you even start. Be open & give
                    yourself
                    grace to LEARN. Tell that voice of doubt to zip it!🤐 You may not yet possess the knowledge to
                    begin
                    coding....but you <span>will</span>! Be courageous enough to take that first step.💪</p>

                <p>In the beginning, watching video tutorials can be helpful but until you actually get hands-on & start
                    doing some coding yourself, you’re not going to do any REAL learning. So go ahead...find that coding
                    class
                    or bootcamp, take a deep breath, jump in & JUST START!👩‍💻</p>
            </div>

            <section id="believe">
                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <h2>Believe in Yourself & Don’t Give Up!</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so you’ve taken the plunge & gotten started; congratulations!👏 Now you’re beginning to code,
                        things are going swell & then all of a sudden,<br>💥<strong>BOOM</strong>💥, there’s something that you don’t understand
                        that’s
                        so far over your head you don’t even know the questions to ask to understand it.😧 <br>This is when
                        you’ve
                        got to dig deep, believe in yourself & <strong>KNOW</strong> that you can find the answer
                        somewhere.🔍 Ask your instructors,
                        fellow students, Google, YouTube or any other resource you can find on the topic you’re
                        struggling with.</p>

                    <p>Problem-solving will help you so much on your learning journey & will motivate you to keep going.
                        I mean, do you ever feel as accomplished as when you figure something out that was truly
                        challenging you?
                        It’s an amazing feeling right?!🙌😁🥳💃</p>

                    <p>So, remember, you can do it! Believe in yourself & don’t give up; your future self will thank
                        you!!</p>
