                <h4>To feel overwhelmed is the lot of the beginner. And the anxiety-prone.</h4>
                <p>Every single thing you're learning is (probably) new. You're building an entire array of skills from 
                    the ground up. Patience is key. If something isn't making sense, take a break, grab a glass of water,
                    sigh, scream (perhaps silently) into the abyss, and start again.</p>

                <p>The saying goes, Rome wasn't built in a day. Neither are coding skills. If you're anything like me,
                    you'll become frustrated with the pace of the program, the pace of the knowledge that you're building.
                    It's natural. The antidote to despair is persistence. Momentum is a powerful tool. Even a page every two
                    days is more than zero pages every three days.</p>

                <h4>You're your own worst critic, fiercest enemy, and closest ally.</h4>
                <p>Odds are, you know yourself better than anyone else does. That means you know your own insecurities and 
                    failings. If you're like me (though hopefully you're not), that means you know how to bully yourself.
                    When your own words come as boulders, every task feels Sisyphean.</p>

                <p>That little voice inside you wants you to give up. Yet try as it might to disguise itself as someone
                    familiar, that little voice isn't you.</p>

                <p>You know your own weaknesses. You also know your own strengths. Even when you feel like you're at your
                    smallest, those strengths are still there. YOU are still there. Breathe. And start again.</p>

                    <br>"The 2019 version of <italic>Cats</italic> exists. I could never make anything that bad."
                    <br>I promise you'll feel better.</h4>
