                <h4>Take your time!</h4>
                <p>Take your time with the lessons. It's easy to want to work through them quickly to get to the next step
                    but it's helpful to take your time and try to really understand what the lesson is teaching you. </p>

                <h4>Have fun!</h4>
                <p>Have fun with learning this new skill. Of course it's overwhelming but try to make sure you are having fun
                    through it all too and making the most of your successes (and failures too!).
