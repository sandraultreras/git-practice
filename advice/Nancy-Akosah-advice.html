            <h4>Keep on trying!</h4>
            <p>There will come a time when you think that you will never be able to figure out this new programming
                language stuff. However, you have to keep on trying and give yourself some grace. It takes time to build
                up skills. It takes time to understand what you are doing. It takes to master certain tasks without
                constantly having to revert back to some of your notes. Even if you do have to look at your notes, SO
                WHAT! You are investing into yourself and it takes time to see the product of your work be successful.
                So, keep going and remember not to give up on yourself. If you give up now, who else can possibly
                motivate you? No one. Have grace and keep up the great work because despite what you may think of your
                current progress YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB!</p>

            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>
