            <h4>Keep Going!</h4>
            <p>It may seem overwhelming at first when learning coding. It a way it like learning any language -
                everything seems foreign and doesn't make much sense. But if you keep going, more and more of the coding
                language will make sense to read and produce. With practice, use and perseverence you will be able to
                use the coding language fluently! Just don't give up!!</p>

            <h4>Take Each Step at a Time.</h4>
            <p> As you go through, try and focus on each step that you are learning, rather than on everything you don't
                know! Each step of the learning to code journey is important. They build on each other so that before
                you know it, may small steps combine to create a lot of knowledge and skill!
