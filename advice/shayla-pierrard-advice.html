                <h4>Be Patient  </h4>

                <p>Learning something new can be very confusing and hard. Sometimese you will need to walk away and try again another day. You have to be patient with yourself and with the process.</p>


                <h4>Perserverance is Key</h4>
                <p>When you have to walk away, keep walking back. There have been times it would be easy to say this is too difficult or confusing, especially when you're getting something right but don't know how or why. Also, when you've ran into a problem and don't quite have the skillset to troubleshoot. Still, keep on keeping on. You will remember why you started and you'll be glad you kept going.
