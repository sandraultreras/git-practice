            <h4>Give yourself some GRACE!</h4>
            <p>For most, this will be your first time learning a new skill that doesn't particularly rely on common
                sense as an instinctive backup. Yes, this will be challenging, but not scary. This will not be something
                that you cannot conquer. Someone is ALWAYS there to help you! This is a completely NO JUDGEMENT ZONE! No
                question is a 'dumb' question. So, please ask away. Never suffer in silence!!</p>

            <h4>Make time for learning and studying!</h4>
            <p>Time management skills will help with getting through the lessons. Having good study habits are
                beneficial and will help with keeping focused on your courses. You can get help with this, as well.</p>

            <h4>Show up for YOU!</h4>
            <p>As mentioned before, this will be challenging. It's only challenging if you do not show up prepared to
                give it your best shot. When it gets tough, get TOUGHER!! We can't wait to CONGRATULATE you upon your
                achievement!!</p>

            <h4>GOOD LUCK!!</h4>
