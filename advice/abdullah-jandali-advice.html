                <h4>Fail early, fail often.</h4>
                <p>Many people are afraid of making mistakes when they do their work. They're afraid of taking risks and
		bringing up bad results, when those bad results are just as important as good ones! You learn the most
		from mistakes, so don't be afraid to make mistakes! The road to success is paved with failure.</p>

                <h4>Focus on the now.</h4>
                <p>Worrying about what the future holds or lamenting what could've been changed in the past is something
		pretty much everyone has done. However, little can be done about things set in stone, or things that haven't
		come to pass yet. It's important to look forward to the future and to remember and learn from the past, but
		your focus must always be on what is happening and what you can achieve in the present.</p>
