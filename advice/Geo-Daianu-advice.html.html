            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>Repetition, Repetition, Repetition!</h4>
            <p>Repetition improves retention. When it comes to programming, practice again and again until the commands
                come naturally, like the lyrics of a song you listened so many times that it requires no effort to sing
                it. When you are up for a challange, find different sources of pratice like free coding camps where you
                might encouter different coding tasks.</p>
