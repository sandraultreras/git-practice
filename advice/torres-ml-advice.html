      <h4>Get out of tutorial hell</h4>
      <p>Stop watching tutorials, doing courses and bootcamps for years. Build a real project and write any code even if it does not work on the first try. </p>

      <p>Use your coding knowledge to build after you learn the basics(HTML, CSS). Look for challenges that force you to apply what you have learned. This is how you find the gaps in your knowledge and what to learn next.</p>

      <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
      <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
        before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
        so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

      <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
        have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
        to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

      <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
      <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
        language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
        the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
      </p>

      <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
        of the process.</p>

      <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
        to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
        totally understand what it's doing.</p>
