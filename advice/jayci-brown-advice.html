                <h4>It's normal to feel overwhelmed</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you most likely have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
                    <p>The important thing is to never give up, but if you need to take a brain break, don't feel guilty about it! Sometimes we need to give ourselves time away from a project in order to observe the knowledge. Most of the time, when you log back in and look at your project with rested eyes, you'll quickly figure out what was stumping you originally!</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Never be afriad to ask questions</h4>
                <p>Everyone here wants to see you succeed and do things you never in a million years thought you'd be able to do, no matter your age, who you are, or where you live.</p>
                <p>It's more likely that the questions you ask are things other students are having trouble with, too but may be too afraid to ask it. You're doing a disservice to yourself (and those around you) by not asking for help when you need it!</p>
