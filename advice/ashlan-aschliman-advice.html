                <h4>You don't need to have everything figured out at the very beginning.</h4>
                <p>Give yourself some grace. If these skills are brand new to you like they are for me, it's going to take some time to retain the new information.</p>    
                    
                <p>Be consistent. Sometimes it will be easier to go a day or two... or more without studying. Try to fight that urge and put in the hard work to be consistent. Even if consistency looks like 20-30 min one day and 1-2 hours the next, do what you can! Feeding your mind this new information everyday is going to help you remain at a steady pace versus a stop/start/re-learn path. Push, push, push! </p>

                <h4>Imposter syndrome is real.</h4>
                <p>Just like with any career or skill- everyone starts somewhere. You have to put in the work to further your knowledge to get where you want to be. Trust the process. You will get there.</p>

                <p>Find community and reach out! You are not alone in your journey.</p>
