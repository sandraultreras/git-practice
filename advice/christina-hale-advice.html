            <h4>Give Yourself Some Grace!</h4>
            <p>Have patience with yourself! Learning computer programming truly is a journey. You will experience
                frustration, confusion, and feeling lost during certain lessons. You will also feel extremely proud of
                yourself for deciding to learn this valuable and in-demand skillset that you can use to build cool projects not only
                while working for a company, but also while doing freelance work too, if you wish. Stay focused, stay
                consistent and keep pushing! You got this!</p>
