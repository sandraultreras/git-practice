            <h4>There are times where you will feel lost.</h4>
            <p>For those intrepid enough to journey towards self-improvement, it is inevitable that you will
                feel lost,
                or insufficent for the task ahead of you. It is only natural, for change is uncomfortable and
                adapting
                to a new skillset takes time and patience.</p>

            <p>I have never seen your face, but I hope your heart is matched to mine. Ambitious, and determined.
                The
                path ahead has nothing you should fear. The only thing that could keep you from your prize is
                your
                own self-doubt. I know that not only are you capable, you are worthy and deserving of the change
                you
                seek.</p>

            <h4>Your path is your own.</h4>
            <p>Your trek is almost definitely different then mine. I want to assure you that moving at the pace
                that is
                right for you is not only permitted; it is required. I personally have had to take long rests
                and even
                stopped moving forward for a time. This is not a condemnation against me, nor would it be of
                you. You
                will reach your destination at the fated moment, and not one second before. I
            </p>

            <p> I have not met another who has had the same strength as you. You are singular, and unique. And I
                am
                delighted and honored that you shared your time with me. Journey well, and keep kindness for
                yourself
                and others.</p>
