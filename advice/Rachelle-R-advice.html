        <h1>Hi, my name is Rachelle and I have some advice for you!</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <div class="advice">
            <h4>Small details matter...<strong>A LOT!</strong></h4>
            <p>Pay cloase attention to the details. For instance, let's say you name your HTML selector <em>skill
                    list</em>. Then you accidentally name your CSS selector <strong>skill<em>s</em></strong> list. This
                small mistake of pluralizing 'skill' will prevent the entire section you are trying to style from
                working.
                If you run into a problem where nothing you are doing in your CSS is changing any value, look to your
                selector names.</p>

            <h4>Don't hesitate to ask for help.</h4>
            <p>I learned my first piece of advice the hard way and didn't follow this piece of advice, to my own detriment. </p>

            <p>I should have asked for help when I could not get a section of my code to work properly.
                Instead I spent countless frustrating hours checking and rechecking my code. I eventually figured it out
                but only after a lot of unnecessary self doubt and discouragement.</p>

            <p>Don't let your fear of appearing foolish drive you down this dark road of self doubt. Don't let a
                stumbling block prevent you from achieving your dreams. Ask when you need help! <em>This piece of advice
                    is a reminder to me as well!</em>
