                <h4>Practice, pratice, and... yes, more pratice...</h4>
                <p>I actually didn't learn most of my front-end knowledge from bootcamps or even tutorials. Before joining Skillcrush (mostly to get official credentials), while I did spend an exorbitant amount of time going through the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials by W3Schools, I learned so much more by creating mock websites for any and every reason I could think of. A lot of details that bootcamps and tutorials might not necessarily get into will surface as you design webpages for various reasons, which will force you to get good at Googling (continued below).</p>

                <h4>Don't be afraid to Google!!!</h4>
                <p>Yes, Googling is an essential skill! Google while you can, because not only will you get humbled and practiced in asking for help, you'll learn a lot about all sorts of problems developers encounter as they code. And there will come a day when - alas! - you can't Google your specific problem, because you're dealing with a problem that probably no one has dealt with before, or you simply don't like the solutions that others have come up with (which often is my problem). So seek help from the web as well as people and books while you can.</p>
