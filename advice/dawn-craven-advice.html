            <h4>If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!</h4>
            <p>I know, it sounds really cliche. It honestly does work.</p>
            <p>Learning new things you are always going to fail before you succeed.</p>
            <p>Don't fight it, beat yourself up about it. Just accept it.</p>
            <p>Failure is inevitable, no getting out of it, none of us are perfect.</p>

            <h4>Invest in yourself and your Future.</h4>
            <p>Check into as many resources as you can find and save them.</p>

            <p>Look for books on everything learned to add to your resource library.</p>

            <p>Even look at some of the middle-school and high-school STEM textbookson coding and web-design.</p>
            <p>The more useful resources you find adds to the things to look for when stuck on anything.</p>
