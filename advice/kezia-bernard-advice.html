                <h4>Repetition is the mother of ALL Skill-crusher </h4>
                <p>The faster you start to practice and repeat the things that confuse you the most, the quicker you will get better.
                    If you are used to being someone that catches on easily to things, throw that idea of yourself out the door.
                    Be willing to be confused. The more you practice, the faster you close the gap of confusion.
                </p>

                <p>Get good at asking the most specific questions you can, whether it's to a trusted mentor or the good old google search.</p>

                <h4>Be a Goldfish -Ted Lasso</h4>
                <p>Let go of the things you do great easily as you do the things that you struggle with.
                    The ebb and the flow of when things are perfect vs when they are frustrating happens so frequently.
                    You are better off having a short memory span and letting it go as fast as you can.
                </p>

            

                <p>Take small moments every couple of weeks to look back just to see how far you've come.
                    I'm sure you are further along then when you started.
