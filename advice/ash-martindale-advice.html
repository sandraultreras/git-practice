            Learning a whole new programming language is going to feel daunting.
            Practice helps! Set aside a little bit of time every day, and you
            will start to understand more and get better.

          <h4>Ask questions!</h4>
          <p>
            Off the bat, you're not going to know or understand everything.
            Studying and practicing will help, but so will relying on your
            network of fellow Skillcrushers. Don't hesitate to reach out if
            you've exhausted your options!

          <h4>Don't be afraid of failure!</h4>
          <p>
            Coding is <em>hard.</em> Sometimes, things won't go the way you
            expect them to, or you might not be able to implement a feature as
            expected. Don't let failure get you down - look at it as an
            opportunity for growth and get creative in figuring out a solution!
