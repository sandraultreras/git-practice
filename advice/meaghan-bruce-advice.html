                <h4>Take a break!</h4>
                <p>When you are working with logic and technical concepts, your brain gets tired.</p>

                <p>If you try to force it to keep working without a break, the brain fog and frustration just gets worse. 
                   <br>Take a 10-15 minute break every hour and try to just clear your mind and not think. You will be surprised 
                   <br>how much more clearly you can work afterwards. Many times, the answer comes right to you after a break!
