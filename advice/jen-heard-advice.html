            <h4>Don't stop trying!</h4>

            <p> It can sometimes feel completely foreign and somewhat frustrating when just starting out but stick with
                it! Nothing that's worth it comes easy. You are bravely taking a step towards learning something
                completely new
                and it will become more and more familiar with time. Keep at it and give yourself the opportunity
                to achieve your goal of making this career change into tech!</p>

            <h4>Make the time!</h4>
            <p>We all lead busy lives these days with constant responsibilities and never ending to-do lists. Make these
                classes and practicing your code one of your top priorities! Everything will still be there waiting when
                you finish with the program and move into that new career. Make a promise to yourself to dedicate no
                less than 30 minutes per day to learning your new skills. In the words of the brilliant Oprah Winfrey,
                <em>"Do what you have to do until you can do what you want to do."</em>.
