            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Consistency is important, but it's alright to take a break sometimes.</h4>
            <p>It's important to stay consistent and make an effort to stay focused on your goals when learning anything
                that is new to you. I started this course 6 times before fully committing to it. I struggled with
                completing lessons and projects until I decided to prioritze and set goals for the things I felt were
                the most important in my life. I've gotten a lot more of my lessons done in the last 2 weeks than I have
                in months. It's been kind of fun, and it feels great!</p>
            <p>With that said, knowing when to take a break is equally as important as consistency, so remember to take it easy on
                yourself!</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>
