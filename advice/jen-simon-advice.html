                <h4>Not Everything is Black or White</h4>
                <p>When you first start programming, you are going to spend a lot of time in the "gray". The "gray" is a sea of
                    ambiguity where you don't know what you don't know. Just getting started can seem to be a Herculean task. All you need
                    to do is take a deep breath and take one baby step at a time.</p>
                
                <h4>Quality over Quantity</h4>
                <p>Remember that this journey is not a race. The only person you are accountable to is yourself. Take care to produce
                    quality work over a subpar quantity of work.</p>

                <h4>Be Forgiving</h4>
                <p>Don't beat yourself up if you are struggling with a concept, or even the entire course. Walk away and take a break,
                    try again, and ask for help when needed.</p>
