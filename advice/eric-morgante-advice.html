        <div class="advice">
            <h4>Believe You Can!</h4>
            <p>Do what you can to see yourself achieving your goal of being a web developer. Surround yourself with
                other students, visualize, and set goals. Whether you think you can or you can't, you are right!
            </p>

            <h4>Celebrate Small Wins!</h4>
            <p>Success in any venture is a series of small wins that by themselves may not seem that significant, but
                when strung together, ultimately add up to that big goal. By celebrating small wins, you associate
                reward with the desirable action, even if it may seem like a small thing. These small things add up!
            </p>

            <h4>Like Learning a Language</h4>
            <p>Even if we don't understand a new language in the beginning, just by gaining exposure, it is being
                internalized subconsciously. So even if code seems new and unfamiliar, the more you work at it, the more
                it will sink in!
