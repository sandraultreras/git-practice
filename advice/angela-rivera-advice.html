        <h1>Advice I'd Give to Myself When I First Started Coding</h1>
        <h3>By: Angela Rivera</h3>
    </header>

    <section>
        <div class="advice">
            <h4>There isn't only one way to solve something.</h4>
            <p>Everyone's mind works differently. As someone who was used to studying topics that had one definite
                answer like in math or biology, I thought it was necessary to solve something in only one way or to have
                only one answer.
                I used to get so distraught when my solution didn't match the solution given in a
                specific lesson or challenge when I first started coding. This would cause me to doubt if I should
                continue coding, even if my solution still worked.
            </p>
            <p> It's okay to do
                things a bit differently; so long as you achieve your desired result, then it should be okay. You may
                not have all the tools to solve something in a certain way right now,
                but you can always learn and improve. There's also no shame in revisiting old projects and applying the
                new things that you've learned. If anything, that's impressive and shows how much you've grown!</p>

            <h4>Small steps everyday add up.</h4>
            <p>Some days, you won't have the energy to code. Some days, life catches up with you and you'll be very
                busy. Some days, you'll feel like you've hit a wall in your coding journey and dread sitting at your
                desk because it all feels like a lot and you worry if you're even smart enough for coding in the first
                place. Try to do a little bit at a time anyway. Even if it's for five minutes, it helps to make coding a
                habit and
                to do a little bit rather than nothing at all. That being said...</p>

            <h4>TAKE BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>I'm someone who gets absorbed in things very easily. It's very hard to get me out of something once I'm
                in it. I'll have a lot of moments where instead of taking a break, I will try to power through and
                expect to find the solution that way. I can tell you for sure that that is inefficient and does
                nothing but make you spiral into burnout.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've found that the days where I've been able to solve a
                problem in my code that has been driving me absolutely insane for hours is the next day after I've taken
                a rest
                and had some time away from my computer. Never underestimate a fresh perspective, especially if you've
                been staring at your code for hours on end.
            </p>

            <h4>It's okay to ask for help.</h4>
            <p>You're going to run into problems. I won't sugarcoat it, you are going to run in to <em>lots and
                    lots</em> of problems.
                The internet has the answers to these problems most of the time. Learn how to do your own research and
                utilize your
                resources. Things like ChatGPT, a Google search, or reading the documentation are all very valuble
                things that may get you the answer faster than having to ask someone. By doing this first, you also show
                initiative in trying to find solutions on your own!</p>

            <p>That being said, it's perfectly okay to ask for help and you're not stupid for not knowing something. It
                may feel
                like that at the time and other people might make you feel like that as well, but that's not true at
                all. As long as you're willing to learn and improve, it's okay to ask for help. If you encounter a
                problem and have already tried to solve it on your own using the resources above but weren't able to
                find any solid answers, then ask!</p>

            <h4>Say it outloud or write it down.</h4>
            <p>
                If you're learning to code, you've probably heard of <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">rubber
                    duck debugging</a>. It's really well-known and that's because it <em>works</em>. Being
                able to hear yourself explain what is going on in your code (or at least what you think is going on in
                your code) helps you catch mistakes or problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've found that writing down my thoughts and being able
                to see my words helps me figure out holes in my logic as well. When I say writing it down, I really mean
                writing it down. I tend to type faster than I can write, so I've learned that when I write something
                down I'm more intentional about it and have a better connection with the things that I write. So,
                grab a pen and a piece of paper and have at it. It makes a world of a difference
                when you're really struggling with a bug in your code.
            </p>

            <h4>Comparison is the thief of joy.</h4>
            <p>Okay, this applies to so much more than just my coding journey. It's a piece of advice I feel like I
                needed to remember back then, but also now. I was comparing myself to other people who were <em>way</em>
                further along
                in their coding journeys than I was, and I would feel miserable about it. I felt like I couldn't enjoy
                my own progress and the fact that I successfully centered a div on my own for the first time, when other
                people were doing so much 'cooler' and more 'impressive' things than I was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your journey is your own,
                not anyone else's. Remember that.</p>

            <h4>Experiment and stay curious.</h4>
            <p>Coding is <em>fun</em>. It's not always fun, but when you're starting out and learning to do all of these things
                for the first time, it's really fun! So, try things out. Make things that are ugly but teach you how things work. Throw your perfectionism
                out the window and just keep creating thing after thing. Continue to make things and do things and just have some fun!</p>
