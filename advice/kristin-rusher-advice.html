                <h4>Don't be intimidated by the unknown!</h4>
                <p>Learning how to code is like learning a whole new language. It
                    can be extremely intimidating to run into words and concepts you've
                    never heard of before, and wonder how you'll ever be able to retain
                    all this new information. But don't let that intimdate you.
                </p>
                <p>Remember that every expert once knew nothing about their area of 
                    expertise. Everyone has to start at the beginning and navigate down
                    the same path you are on right now. With each step you take, you'll
                    master another aspect of coding. Before you know it, you'll be fluent
                    in the language of coding.
                </p>
                <p>So don't give up! Take this journey one step at a time and you'll
                    be rewarded.
