            <h4>Continue when it's hard!</h4>
            <p> There are going to be many times where either the code does not match what you were going for
                or something happens and you do not know why. It is extremely important to continue to code and
                not be discouraged. Sometimes you might feel like giving up, but in order to move forward you have to
                keep trying.

            <h4> Ask for help!</h4>
            <p> It is okay to ask for help when you are having issues with your code. Reaching out to others on a forum
                can help you to continue to learn and improve your code. Also, using forums can be encouraging
                because they are a reminder that some day you will be able to help someone with their coding issues if
                you
                continue to strive to improve your coding abilities.
            </p>

        <div class="advice">
            <h4> Be Positive!</h4>
            <p> It is vital to have a positive attitude when coding.
            </p>

            <p> There are many times when you run into coding issues while learning. It is important to remain positive
                and use these challenges as learning moments and not be discouraged by them.
