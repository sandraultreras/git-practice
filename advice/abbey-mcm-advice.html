                <h4>Taking notes is your friend!</h4>
                <p>My biggest mistake when I began my lessons was not taking notes as I went along. I've found that taking notes helps to reinforce key terms and also assists with comprehension of the material.</p>

                <p>It has been a while since I was in school but this was always the way I learned best. Write out definitions as you would have in science class. Get out your highlighters and different color inks. I know that younger students may be more accustomed to typing out notes on their computers...which is great too! Find what works for you.</p>

                <h4>Don't be afrait to repeat lessons!
                </h4>
                <p>As I mentioned before I didn't take notes initially when I started the HTML and CSS classes. I also found that I was able to follow steps to create the projects they give you. However, I didn't fully understand WHY I was supposed to use a particular code in order to accomplish a particular outcome.</p>

                <h4> Utilize Slack as much as possible!</h4>

                <p>Slack was new to me when I began Skillcrush. However, it has proved a lifesaver on more than one occasion. You have opportunity to meet other Skillcrushers who, like you, are learning so many new skills. You also have access to Skillcrush mentors who can assist you with problems that you may run into.</p>

                <p>Each lesson you take has it's own Slack channel so you don't have to weed through unrelated material when trying to troubleshoot an issue.</p>
